# CPS3250_project


**Project Objective**:

- Use Python to implement scheduling algorithms such as FCFS and SJF, and generate random tasks to test performance indicators such as CPU usage and average completion time.
- Migrate the algorithm to the Alibaba Cloud virtual computing environment to run and analyze the performance of the algorithm in the cloud environment.
- Compare the efficiency of the algorithm through data visualization, write an analysis report and draw an academic poster.


**File**:
- two python file
